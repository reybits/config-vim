# Vim from Scratch

This repository contains my custom Vim configuration for Linux, macOS, and Windows. The setup is built from scratch and includes only the plugins I actively use in my workflow. I primarily use Vim as a C++ IDE for cross-platform game development.

For the best experience, use it alongside my [config-tmux](https://github.com/reybits/config-tmux.git) repository.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/reybits/config-vim.git ~/.config/vim
```

## Features

- Plugin management via plug.
- Git integration via vim-fugitive.
- Nice and lightweight statusline via airline.
- Fuzzy finder via fzf.
- Easy code commenting via tcomment.
- Code formatting via vim-autoformat.
- C++ support via coc.
- Colorscheme via gruvbox.
- And more...
